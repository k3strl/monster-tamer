# Monster Tamer – A Phaser 3 Game

Monster Tamer is a short video game demo built with Phaser 3, developed while following Scott Westover’s Phaser 3 tutorial series on YouTube. This project has served as both a coding milestone and a practical exercise in applying & reinforcing newly learned front-end development concepts through interactive game design.

## Features

- Monster encounters and simple taming mechanics
- Built entirely with JavaScript and the Phaser 3 framework
